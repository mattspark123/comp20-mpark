1. Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.
Should all work correctly!

2. Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.
Much credit to Google Maps API developer guides, I used their info window document, polyline document, marker document, and etc to learn how to implement. I don't think I copied and pasted anything, except for the function to handle your own geolocation. Located here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/map-geolocation
Even then, I modified it to fit my own code. Also used stackoverflow for a couple ideas, but did not copy anything.

Asked classmate Phan Anh for help with XML syntax, just to clarify something we learned in class (I missed one class due to an interview). He did not see my code nor did I see his.

3. Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.
Probably 20-25?
