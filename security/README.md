# 1. Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.
I wish that I could have found a better third security fault. The other parts are working well.
# 2. Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.

# 3. Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.
5-6?
