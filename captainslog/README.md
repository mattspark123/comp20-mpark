1. Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.

Everything should work, except that I can't figure out how to preserve things in local storage right now. Will update when fixed.

2. Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.

No one so far, might have to drop by office hours.

3. Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.

Maybe 2.5-3 hours so far.
