1. Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.

Everything should work!

2. Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.

No one, just the class examples and the jquery website like a lot

3. Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.

Maybe 3.5 hours. Took me a while to figure out local storage.
