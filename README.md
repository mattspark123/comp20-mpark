# 1. What is this purpose of this Git repository? (duh!)

The git repository was a way for us to learn how to use git. It was also a convenient way to store all of our work, as well as a portfolio to show what we learned throughout the course.

# 2. What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?

My favorite assignment was assignment 2, because I thought that it had the best balance between difficuluty and fun. 

# 3. How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?

I think that I've grown a lot, because on top of learning some valuable skills, I've developed a different perspective of ubiquitous things like websites and apps. And, I have some experience working with HTML and APIs now, so I can conceivably self teach in the future and have a springboard to jump off of.

# 4. What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.

I think the use of HTML along with APIs was the most important thing I learned. An example would be Google Maps API from assignment 2, because it showed me the power of repurposing others peoples' work. jQuery was another example of how we could use APIs for own benefit.

# 5. Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?

I wish that we had spent more time on front end. I think that if I were to go on and do something of my own, I would work on making my website from assignment 1 into something that I could proudly show other people.
